Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page
Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to.

Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page.

If you want to link to a specific part of a different page (whether on your own site or a different website) you can use a similar technique

As long as the page you are linking to has id attributes that identify specific parts of the page

For example, to link to the bottom of the homepage of the website that accompanies this book

The <h1> element is used with an id attribute at the top of the page so that a link can be added to take readers from the bottom of the page to the top.

There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

Choosing Images for Your Site

Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description. If you do not have photographs to use on your website, 

Images should...
Be relevant
 Convey information
 Convey the right mood
 Be instantly recognisable
 Fit the color palette
 
 Online extra
We have provided an online gallery that helps you choose the right image for your website. You can find it in the tools section of the site accompanying this book.

On a big site you might like to add subfolders inside the images folder. For example, images such as logos and buttons might sit in a folder called interface, product photographs might sit in a page called products

Adding Images
To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

src
This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images â€” relative URLs were covered on pages 83-84)
Height & Width of Images

height:-  This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

width :- This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.




Where to Place Images in Your Code :- 

Where an image is placed
in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:
1: before a paragraph :- The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
2: inside the start of a paragraph :-  The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image

3: in the middle of a paragraph :- 
The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

4- Old Code: Aligning Images Horizontally
The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an imag.

left :- This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).

right :- This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side). This aligns the image to the right
(allowing text to flow around its
left-hand side).


Aligning Images Vertically : -

As you saw on the last page, the align attribute is no longer used in HTML5, but it is covered here because you may see it used in older websites and it is still used in the code created by some visual editors.
top :-This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image.

middle :- This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.

bottom This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.



Three Rules for Creating Images : 

1- Save images in the right format
2- Save images at the right size.
3- Use the correct resolution.


Tools to Edit & Save Images : 

There are several tools you can use to edit and save images to ensure that they are the right size, format, and resolution. loike photoshop

Image Dimensions :- 
The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.

Cropping Images :- 
When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.

Image Resolution :- 
Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file

Vector Images :- 
Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

Animated GIFs :- 
Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations

Transparency :- Creating an image that is partially transparent (or "see-through") for the web involves selecting one of two formats.

Examining Images on the Web :-

Checking the Size of Images 

If you are updating a website, you might need to check the size of an existing image before creating a new one to replace it. This can be achieved by right-clicking on the image and making a selection from the pop-up menu that appears. (Mac users will need to hold down the control key and click rather than right-click.)

Example :- 

Color :- 

This example shows a pH scale to demonstrate the different ways that colors can be specified using CSS (using color names, hex codes, RGB, and HSL)

1- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
2- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
3- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
4- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
5-  CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
6- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

CSS3: HSL Colors.
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.

hue
Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
saturation
Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray

lightness
Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity

Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)

Serif  :- Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.

Sans-Serif : Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner desigin

Choosing a Typeface for your Website 
When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.

Serif :- Serif fonts have extra details on the end of the main strokes of the letters.
Sans-Serif :- Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters and therefore have a much cleaner design.

Techniques That Offer a Wider Choice of Typefaces

There are several ways to use fonts other than those listed on the previous page. However, typefaces are subject to copyright, so the techniques you can choose from are limited by their respective licenses.
font-family :- The user's computer needs the typeface installed. CSS is used to specify the typeface
font-face :- CSS specifies where a font can be downloaded from if it is not installed on the computer.
Service-based Font-Face :- Commercial services give users access to a wider range of fonts using @font-face.

Type Scales :- You may have noticed that programs such as Word, Photoshop and InDesign offer the same sizes of text.
Units of Type Size :- Setting font size in pixels is the
best way to ensure that the type appears at the size you intended (because percentages and ems are more likely to vary if a user has changed the default size of text in their browser).

More Font Choice :-  e allows you to use
a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded is it is not on the user's machine.

Understanding Font Format :- 
Different browsers support different formats for fonts (in the same way that they support different audio and video formats), 

1- Bold 2- italic 

UpperCase & LowerCase :- 

uppercase and lowercase
This causes the text to appear uppercase.

lowercase :- This causes the text to appear
lowercase. 

Underline & Strike (text-decoration ) : 

none
This removes any decoration already applied to the text.

underline This adds a line underneath the text

overline :- This adds a line over the top of the text. line-through

Leading line-height :- 
Leading (pronounced ledding) is a term typographers use for the vertical space between lines of text. In a typeface, the part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline is called a descender

Letter & Word Spacing :- 
Kerning is the term
typographers use for the space between each letter. You can control the space between each letter with the letter-spacing property

Alignment :- 
text-align :- The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of text. The property can take one of four values:
left :- This indicates that the text should be left-aligned.
right :- This indicates that the text should be right-aligned.
center :- This allows you to center text.
justify :- This indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the last line, should be set to take up the full width of the containing box.
