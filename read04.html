Definition Lists
<d1 > The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
<dt> This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
  <dd>
This is used to contain the definition.Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term.

    Nested Lists
 
    You can put a second list inside
an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.
    Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list. In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change the style of the bullet point too.
    
links & Linking to Other Sites ;-
    
    Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
    
    you can use <a> tags to link it to other web site.
    
    Directory Structure
Structure
The diagram on the right shows the directory structure for a fictional entertainment listings website called ExampleArts.
   
    Relationships
The relationship between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree. 
Homepages
The main homepage of a site
written in HTML (and the homepages of each section in a child folder) is called index.html    
    
    Every page and every image on a website has a URL (or UniformResource Locator).
    The path to the homepage of this site is www.examplearts.com/index.html
    
    Relative URLs
    Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files
    
    When you are linking to a page on your own website, you do not need to specify the domain name. You can use relative URLs which are a shorthand way to tell the browser where a page is in relation to the current page.
    
    Email Links
    To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element.
    
   
    
the layout 
    LISTS, TABLES AND FORMS

    tables :- The <td> elements are the data containers of the table.
They can contain all sorts of HTML elements; text, images, lists, other tables, etc.
    
    lists ;- In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms. 
    X List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
X Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
X Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
X Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
    
    
   Containing Elements
    If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
    
    Controlling the Position of Elements
    CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page.
    
    java instructions 
    
    A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). Expressions evaluate into a single value.
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
    
    How does pair programming work?
hile there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
    
    Why pair program? 
    While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages.
    
    1. Greater efficiency

    It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making.
    
     Engaged collaboration
    
    When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.
    
    3. Learning from fellow students
Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

  4. Social skills
Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isnâ€™t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself.

5. Job interview readiness
A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base. By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.
