What is HTML and CSS?

The HTML is ;-

 stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
 is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
 describes the structure of a Web page
consists of a series of element HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content  elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


The CSS ;- 

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files 


How People Access the Web ?

Browsers
People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

2- ) Web Servers :- When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website. 

3- ) Devices  :- People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers

4- ) Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How Websites Are Created ? All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

What you see
When you are looking at a website, it is most likely that your browser will be receiving HTML and CSS from the web server that hosts the site.

How it is Created
Small websites are often written just using HTML and CSS. Larger websites — in particular those that are updated regularly and use a content management system (CMS).

HTML5 & CSS3
Since the web was first created there have been several versions of HTML and CSS — each intended to be an improvement on the previous version. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

How the Web Works ? 

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

1- ) When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

2- ) Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.

3- ) The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Structure :- 

Many web pages act like electronic versions of these documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce facilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML Describes the Structure of Pages ;- 

In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.




and there are 

elements ;- s. Elements are usually made up of two tags .

tags :-  and there are to types of tags  ( an opening tag and a closing tag )  . 

the closing tag is :- The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.







--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages.

   




  




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the open tag and closing tag :- 

Opening Tag ;- for example  <p>        The characters in the brackets indicate the tag's purpose. 

left-angle bracket   ;- (less-than sign) 

RIGHT-angle bracket ;- (MORE-than sign)  

Closing tag ;-    for example  </p>    Strictly speaking, however, an element comprises the opening

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attributes Tell Us More About Elements 

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.  




Paragraph in English

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Body, Head & Title 

You met the <body> :-  element in the first example we created. Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.

Anything written between the <body> tags will appear in the main browser window,

 the Head tag ;- element you will often see a element. This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a title inside it .

 the forms  ;- The element uses the action attribute to indicate the page that the data is being sent to. Each of the form controls sits inside the element.

Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a element. X Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs. X Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server. X HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Evolution of HTML   ;- 

Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML

first of them is ;- 

HTML 4 (1997) ;- With the exception of a few
elements added in HTML5
Although HTML 4 had some presentational elements to control the appearance of pages,


XHTML 1.0 ;-  

In 1998, a language called XML was published. 

Every element needed a closing tag (except for empty elements such as ). 

All attributes required a value, and all values were to be placed in double quotes

HTML5 ;- Released 2000 

In HTML5, web page authors do not need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced. At the time of writing, the HTML5 specification had not been completed,

----------------------------------------------------------------

DOCTYPEs ;- Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).

Comments in HTML <!--  type your comment here if you want to comment -->

-----------------------------------------------------------------

ID Attribute ;-  Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. 

Class Attribute ;- Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document.

Block Elements ;- Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.  <h1> , <p1> , <ul> , <li>

Inline Elements  ;- Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements. <a> , <b> , <em> , and <img>




Grouping Text & Elements In a Block ;-  The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.




You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.

Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS

To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

Headers & Footers  ;- The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

In this example, the element used to contain the site name and the main navigation.

the <nav>  tag ;- The element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

the articale tag ;- The element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

the <aside> ;- ement has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an

the < section> ;- element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

the < figure > ;- . It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images). 

Who is the Site For? 

Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

Why People Visit YOUR Website ? 

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve ? 

It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs .

Site Maps ;- To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting.

WireFrames ;- A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT  iN THE BROWSER 

the javascript helps to ;- 

Access the content of the page
Modify the content of the page
Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
React to events triggered by the user or browser 

and they can help to achive ;-

SLIDESHOWS ;- s can display a number of different images (or other HTML content).

FORMS ;- Validating forms (checking whether they have been filled in correctly) is important when information is supplied by users

RELOAD PART OF PAGE ;- You might not want to force visitors to reload the content of an entire web page, particularly if you only need to refresh a small portion of a page.

FILTERING DATA  ;- If you have a lot of information to display on a page, you can help users find information they need by providing filters.

BROWSER SUPPORT   ;- Some early examples in this book do not work with Internet Explorer 8
and earlier

what is a script ;-  A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE ? 

In order to understand how you can change the content of an HTML page using JavaScript, you need to know how a browser interprets the HTML code and applies styling to it. 

1: RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE 

Each page on a website can be seen as a separate document . So, the web consists of many sites, each made up of one or more documents.

 2: CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY ;-

The model shown on the right hand page is a representation of one very basic page. Its structure is reminiscent of a family tree

3: USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN
